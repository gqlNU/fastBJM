# fastBJM: An efficient and scalable Bayesian algorithm for fitting joint models of longitudinal and event history data

Joint models are computationally expensive to fit due to the complex joint likelihood and the need to estimate a large number of individual-level random effects. In this paper, we propose fastBJM, an efficient algorithm for fitting Bayesian joint models using Markov chain Monte Carlo.

fastBJM is written in R. **The full set of code for the algorithm and for the simulation studies will be made available on this site.**
