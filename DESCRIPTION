Description: Joint models are computationally expensive to fit due to the
    complex joint likelihood and the need to estimate a large number of
    individual-level random effects. We propose fastBJM, an efficient and
    scalable algorithm for fitting Bayesian joint models using Markov
    chain Monte Carlo.
